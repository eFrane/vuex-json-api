# Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome from anyone and everyone.
Good ways to contribute are:

- Creating or commenting on open issues
- Creating pull requests for new features (check issues first!) or bug fixes
- Creating pull requests to improve upon the documentation

The current contribution policy is that all changes must be made in a pull-request.
The general procedure for getting a pull request merged is:

- Open PR (d'uh) with a short description of the changes
- Wait for review of at least one project member. Ideally, the reviewing
  member was not involved in the changes made in the PR.
- When no changes are requested and the PR is approved, it will be merged
  timely, unless there's a reason to not merge it which will usually be
  stated in the PR comments.
