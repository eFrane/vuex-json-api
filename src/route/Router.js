/**
 * Basic router implementation for the ResourcefulApi.
 *
 * Automagically creating api bound modules builds on
 * an understanding of the available routes. To
 * easily instantiate a Store bound to an endpoint,
 * route information for that endpoint must be provided.
 *
 * Since every endpoint is implemented differently and
 * the choice where this route information comes from
 * should be left to the endpoint developer, this
 * library only assumes that route loading can be a
 * asynchronous process which eventually returns and
 * has a set of `Route` objects in `this.routes`,
 * keyed by their module and methods. To ensure the latter,
 * actually adding `Route`s should be done via `addRoute`.
